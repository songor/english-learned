# Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

> I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college, and this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

**commencement**

`SYN` graduation

> The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?

**drop out**

To leave a school or university before your course has finished.

**drop-in**

A drop-in place is a place offering a service or support where you can go without having to make arrangements first.

If you drop in on someone, you visit them informally, usually without having arranged it.

**or so**

Used when you cannot be exact about a number, amount, or period of time and you think it may be a little more than the figure you are mentioning.

> It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.

**biological**

A childâ€™s parent through birth, rather than through adoption.

**put up**

Put somebody up to let someone stay in your house and give them meals.

**adoption**

Put the baby up for adoption.

> So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking:"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said:"Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college. This was the start in my life.

**relent**

If you relent, you allow someone to do something that you had previously refused to allow them to do.

> And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.

**naive**

If you describe someone as naive, you think they lack experience and so expect things to be easy or people to be honest or kind.

**working-class**

The group of people in society who traditionally do physical work and do not have much money or power.

> And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
